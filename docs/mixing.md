# How to Mix Music

[This video from "The Band Guide" by Colin](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I5zWgfpo8mA) outlines a simple six-step process for achieving professional-sounding mixes specifically within Logic Pro. It emphasizes that a professional mix isn't about complex techniques but rather following a structured approach. A free downloadable guide is also available to accompany these steps.

## The Six Steps to a Pro Mix

### Step 1: The Static Mix
The static mix is considered the most crucial and simplest part of the mixing process.
*   **Focus**: Volume and pan position are the only two elements to focus on.
*   **Goal**: Make the mix sound as good as possible *without* any plugins or effects.
*   **Volume Impact**: Volume significantly affects how elements are perceived; louder sounds appear brighter, more upfront, and have more low-end, while quieter sounds appear duller and further away.
*   **Process**:
    *   Remove any non-sound-shaping plugins (e.g., reverbs that aren't part of the core sound).
    *   Bring all track volumes down to zero.
    *   Bring volumes up in order of importance, starting with the most important element (e.g., vocals) and mixing other elements around it (e.g., vocals, then kick/snare, then other drums, then low-end, then mid-range).
*   **Tips**:
    *   **Headroom**: Maintain -6 to -3 dB of headroom on the stereo output/master track (using a level meter plugin) to avoid digital clipping. Start mixing in the loudest section of the song (e.g., final chorus).
    *   **Wide Panning**: Utilize wide panning (far left and far right) to create a big, wide-sounding mix, ensuring balance across the stereo field.

### Step 2: Master Track Processing (Top-Down Mixing)
This step involves subtle processing on the entire song (stereo output, master track, two bus, or mix bus) to make it feel cohesive.
*   **Plugins**: Focus on a little bit of EQ and compression.
*   **EQ**: Be super subtle (1-3 dB boosts or cuts) and primarily focus on the low-end (sub/bass) and high-end (brightness/sheen).
*   **Compression**: Be very subtle; recommended settings are a 30 ms attack time, around 100 ms release time, and a 3:1 ratio (adjustable for genre), aiming for 2-3 dB of gain reduction in the loudest sections.
*   **Benefit**: This step helps the mix gel together and can save time on individual track processing later.

### Step 3: EQ on Individual Channels
EQ is described as the most powerful actual tool in Logic Pro for shaping sounds, adding clarity, definition, and presence, as well as minimizing unwanted sounds.
*   **Concept**: Think of EQ simply as two moves (boost or cut) with three goals:
    1.  **Highlight the good**: Boost desirable frequencies to make elements stand out.
    2.  **Minimize the bad**: Cut undesirable frequencies (e.g., boxiness or wooliness in the mid-range) to clean up the sound.
    3.  **Make space for every source**: Use cuts (e.g., high-pass filters on microphones) to create clarity and punch in specific frequency ranges for other instruments (e.g., kick drum and bass low-end).
*   **Tips**:
    *   If you struggle to hear EQ, boost drastically until you hear the effect, then scale it back to a reasonable level or cut.
    *   Most EQ moves are between 4-6 dB, but do "as little as you can but as much as you need" (even 9-15 dB if necessary).

### Step 4: Compression
Compression is an "automatic volume fader" that is often misunderstood by home studio artists but widely used by professionals.
*   **Purpose**: Smooth out big audio peaks, make drums punchier, or bring up quieter details in vocals.
*   **Core Concepts**:
    *   **Threshold**: The point at which the compressor starts turning down the sound.
    *   **Attack Time**: How quickly the sound is turned down once it crosses the threshold (longer for punch, quicker for smoothing peaks).
    *   **Release Time**: How quickly the volume turns back up after being compressed (short for quick pops, slow for sustained reduction).
    *   **Ratio**: How intensely the sound is turned down (a lighter ratio turns down less, a higher ratio turns down more).
    *   **Makeup Gain**: Used to compensate for the volume loss inherently caused by compression.

### Step 5: Effects
Effects like reverb and delay should be introduced later in the mixing process to avoid muddiness.
*   **Benefit of Delaying**: Waiting until this step ensures clarity and helps identify if effects are causing muddiness.
*   **Common Effect Types**:
    *   **Small Room Reverbs**: Create a realistic space.
    *   **Medium to Long Reverbs**: Lighter, more obvious, fill space, often for slower mixes/sounds.
    *   **Time Delay**: In time with the song (e.g., "delay, delay, delay").
    *   **Slapback Delay**: Very fast delay that's not overtly noticeable but gives a "slapping back off a wall" effect.
*   **Tips**:
    *   **Felt, Not Heard**: The best effects are felt rather than overtly heard; bring them up until you hear them, then scale them back slightly.
    *   **Use Buses**: Buses save time and create a more cohesive sound by allowing you to send multiple tracks to a single effect plugin.

### Step 6: Automation
Automation is the final step, allowing precise, dynamic tweaks to the mix.
*   **Concept**: It's like having Logic Pro automatically adjust parameters (e.g., volume, panning, effects) throughout the song.
*   **Recommended Automation Points**:
    1.  **Vocal Volume (Vocal Riding)**: After compression, listen to the vocal in context and automate volume to ensure it's always audible (boosting quiet parts, lowering loud parts, or subtly raising the end of phrases).
    2.  **Pan Knob**: Adjust panning to create more or less width at different points (e.g., guitars slightly in for verses, wide for choruses).
    3.  **Effect Automation**: Vary effect levels (e.g., reverb/delay) to create different spatial feelings (e.g., less effects in verses for intimacy, more in choruses for grandeur).
*   **Key Mistake to Avoid**: Do *not* automate volumes too early; wait until this final step after compression.

## Important Note on Loudness
The video stresses that mixing is *not* where a song is made loud. A finished mix following these steps will likely sound quiet, which is normal. Mastering is the subsequent process where the overall volume level is brought up to commercial standards.
