Here are some key techniques to make your MIDI organ sound more realistic and polished:

**Layering and voicing:**
- Use multiple organ samples or synth layers with slight detuning between them to create natural chorusing effects
- Mix different drawbar combinations or tonewheel settings to add harmonic complexity
- Consider layering a subtle electric piano or pad underneath for warmth

**Effects processing:**
- Add vintage-style tube saturation or tape compression for warmth and character
- Use rotary speaker simulation (Leslie cabinet) with proper slow/fast switching behavior
- Apply subtle chorus or vibrato that matches the organ type you're emulating
- Light reverb can help - spring reverb for vintage electric organs, hall reverb for church organs

**Dynamics and expression:**
- Vary your velocity and use expression pedal data if available
- Program realistic swell pedal movements for church organs
- Add subtle volume automation to mimic natural playing variations
- Use aftertouch or mod wheel for vibrato control

**EQ and frequency shaping:**
- Roll off extreme highs and lows unless you're going for a very modern sound
- Boost slightly around 2-4kHz for presence and clarity
- Consider cutting some low-mids around 300-500Hz to reduce muddiness

**Performance techniques:**
- Play with appropriate articulation - organs don't have velocity-sensitive attack like pianos
- Use proper chord voicings and bass pedal techniques
- Add subtle timing variations rather than playing perfectly quantized

**Context in the mix:**
- Give the organ its own frequency space - don't compete with guitars in the same range
- Use stereo width appropriately - narrow for focused sound, wider for ambient parts

The key is subtlety - small amounts of multiple effects usually work better than heavy processing.
