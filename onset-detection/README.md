## prompt
Help me build an onset detection library with Python using PyDub for audio format standardization and Librosa for feature extraction and onset detection.

The goal is to use pitch and onset information to export a standard time map to later be used for temporal alignment for web based audio playback

create a makefile that runs basic commands

the first command should create an mp3 file from the first, containing the the first 30 seconds of the sample - in this case, see mp3/variation-1.mp3

this sample will later be used by index.html for audio playback

the second command should generate a timemap from the sample file. use a separate python class and file for this with librosa for generating the time map


## Qs

- what are ways we can visualize BPM over a sound wave as a mask
    - markers per measure
    - beat grid
    - do I need to worry about rubato?

- BPM guessing game
- BPM is already a flawed concept in rubato
- its more llike beats per measure
- the truth is
