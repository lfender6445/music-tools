- [x] always truncate sample so its 30 seconds of audio and there is no leading silence
- [x] remove pydub
- [x] do not mutate the input file from which the sample is generated
- [] refactor code by algorithms for onset detection
- [] try an advanced onset detection lib like PLPDP
- [] start with the simple 120 bpm scale samples
- [] work your way up to variation 1
- [] try more variations
- [] setup demos for each algorithm, evaluating each on performance
